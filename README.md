## Nintendult

Hi there.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nintendult), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-M_7sLCZ4JAj3r1pIZmwUQ), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nintendult), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/nintendult), and even [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Nintendult). I don't use that last one often though. You can find me on other places, too, but I won't bore you with links.

I am an organizer for the Sound of Community online festival. You can find their site [here](https://www.soundof.community). We stream on our [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soundofcommunity) page.

I am a manager for [Daft Shit Records](https://soundcloud.com/daft_shit). We're the best net label.
