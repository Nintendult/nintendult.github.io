## Nintendult

Hi there.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nintendult), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-M_7sLCZ4JAj3r1pIZmwUQ), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nintendult), and even [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Nintendult). I don't use that last one often though. You can find me on other places, too, but I won't bore you with links.

I am an organizer for the Sound of Community online festival. You can find their site [here](https://sites.google.com/view/soundofcommunity). We stream on our [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soundofcommunity) page.
